# daru
The "Social media" project of "daru" group
In this project, we have tried to implement a ui for a social media application
The project provides a very simple interface to transfer data from one part of memory to another

After registerin in our programm you can communicate with other registered accounts using messaging system provided in the app

We have failed to provide a setting for every user, so you cannot change your registration data and set a profile picture

Duo to the previous point, you also cannot see anyone's profile picture, because no one can have one :)

We have also failed to make the graph feature for contacts in anyone's profile page

Other than those two parts, the project is tested in most ways to work and isn't expected to have any bugs

Sincerely
Daru :D
